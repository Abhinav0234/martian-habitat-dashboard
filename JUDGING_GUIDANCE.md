# Judging Guidance for Divergent Teams DC Hackathon CS Track

## Overview
As a judging consultant for the Divergent Teams DC Hackathon CS track, I've reviewed the prompt for creating a team website. The project requires building a clean, minimalistic website inspired by Apple iOS26 liquid glass design, featuring team profiles, navigation, and responsive layout. Below, I outline key criteria judges prioritize, along with analysis and tips for maximizing scores.

## Key Judging Criteria

### 1. Relevance to the Prompt
   - **What Judges Look For**: Strict adherence to the specified structure (Header, Hero, Team, About, Contact, Footer), design guidelines (colors: white/blue, glass effects, sans-serif fonts), and content placeholders. Submissions must include all required sections and elements without major omissions.
   - **Analysis**: The prompt is detailed, so judges will penalize deviations like missing sections or ignoring the iOS26-inspired aesthetic. Relevance ensures the submission aligns with the hackathon's theme.
   - **Tips**: Double-check against the prompt checklist. If adding extras (e.g., advanced JS), ensure they enhance rather than replace core requirements.

### 2. Innovation
   - **What Judges Look For**: Creative interpretations of the "liquid glass" design, such as unique animations, interactive elements, or personalized touches to team profiles. Innovation goes beyond basic implementation to show originality.
   - **Analysis**: While the prompt is prescriptive, judges reward teams that elevate the design with subtle innovations, like dynamic backgrounds or custom hover effects, without overcomplicating.
   - **Tips**: Experiment with CSS filters for glass effects or JS libraries for smooth transitions. Avoid generic templates; add a unique flair, like animated team introductions.

### 3. Functionality
   - **What Judges Look For**: The website must load correctly, be responsive across devices, and include working interactive features (e.g., smooth scrolling, modals). No broken links, errors, or non-functional elements.
   - **Analysis**: Functionality is foundational; a beautiful site that doesn't work loses points. Judges test on multiple devices/browsers.
   - **Tips**: Test thoroughly using browser dev tools. Ensure mobile responsiveness with media queries. Validate HTML/CSS/JS for errors.

### 4. User Experience (UX)
   - **What Judges Look For**: Intuitive navigation, readable content, smooth interactions, and accessibility. The site should feel polished, with no clutter or confusing layouts.
   - **Analysis**: UX ties into the minimalistic design; judges assess ease of use, visual hierarchy, and engagement. Poor UX can overshadow technical skills.
   - **Tips**: Prioritize fast load times, clear CTAs, and semantic HTML. Use tools like Lighthouse for UX audits. Ensure text is legible and sections flow logically.

### 5. Technical Implementation
   - **What Judges Look For**: Clean, efficient code (HTML, CSS, JS), adherence to best practices, and appropriate use of technologies. Judges review code quality, commenting (if any), and scalability.
   - **Analysis**: For a CS track, technical depth matters—e.g., vanilla JS over frameworks unless justified. Poor code (e.g., inline styles everywhere) indicates inexperience.
   - **Tips**: Organize code into separate files. Use modern CSS (flexbox/grid) for layouts. Avoid unnecessary libraries; keep it lightweight. Run linters if possible.

## Overall Tips for Success
- **Balance All Criteria**: Don't sacrifice functionality for innovation—aim for a well-rounded submission.
- **Demo Preparation**: Prepare a live demo or video walkthrough, highlighting key features and how they meet the prompt.
- **Time Management**: Allocate time for testing and refinement; rushed submissions often fail on UX or functionality.
- **Documentation**: Include a brief README explaining your approach, challenges, and how you addressed the criteria.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Over-designing (ignoring simplicity), ignoring responsiveness, or not replacing placeholders with actual content.

Judges value submissions that demonstrate both creativity and competence. Focus on delivering a professional, prompt-aligned website that stands out in execution.
